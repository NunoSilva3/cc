# Full Stack Coding Challenge

## Instructions

For the coding challenge it is going to be a very short one. The goal is just to see how you can pick up new technologies.

Creating a full stack application we would like a you to create a fun application that makes a get request to the Chuck Norris API (http:*//api.icndb.com/jokes/random*) and based on the joke add it to your favorites. How you design it or organize it is up to you but these are the requirements that must be fulfilled:

## Getting Started

- Fork this repo
- install all your dependencies
- Try and follow the best git flow you can with semantic commits
- when done make a pull request

Depending on your famility with Angular I would suggest doing the tutorial on the Angular website(Tour of Heroes) as it has the best documentation I've seen and it does a really good job at getting you familiar with the framework.

## Front End

Angular 7 - please design with mobile in mind

## Back End

NodeJs - Express

Please just have _one_ endpoint that makes the call to the api. BUT, we would like you to follow the MVC paradigm for seperation of concern.  

## Due 

We understand that time is important, which is why we would like for you to be as close as done within 2 days of recieving the challenge. Angular will be a big divergence from React, however, if you are familiar with Vue then there will be some more similarities. When we talk in person we will go over the project together.



### Extra Credit

- Use Ionic 4 (extra extra credit: Ionic)
- Use Koa as a backend framework, we use this framework for micro services
- Write tests (with any framework, however, we use Jest)
- Data persistence, either with a JSON file or local storage
