# Full Stack Coding Challenge

## Instructions

The coding challenge it is going to be a very short one.

Creating a full stack application we would like a you to create a fun application that makes a get request to the Chuck Norris API (http:*//api.icndb.com/jokes/random*) and based on the joke add it to your favorites, as well as the ability to remove it. How you design it and organize it is up to you but these are the requirements that must be fulfilled:
- Click a button that shows a joke
- Have the option to add the joke to your favorite jokes list, and be able to redily see the list of favorited jokes
- Have the option to remove a joke from your list
- Your list must not contain any duplicates

## Getting Started

- Fork this repo
- Install the dependencies
- Try and follow the best git flow you can with semantic commits
- When done make a pull request

Depending on your famility with Angular I would suggest doing the tutorial on the Angular website(Tour of Heroes) as documentation is some of the best I've seen and it does a really good job at getting you familiar with the framework.

## Front End

Angular 7 - please design with mobile in mind

## Back End

NodeJs - Express

Please just have _one_ endpoint that makes the call to the api. BUT, we would like you to follow the MVC paradigm for seperation of concern.  

## Due 

We understand that time is important, which is why we would like for you to be as close as done within 2 days of recieving the challenge. Angular will be a big divergence from React, however, if you are familiar with Vue then there will be some more similarities. When we talk in person we will go over the project together.



### Extra Credit

- Use Ionic 4 (extra extra credit: Cordova for native plugins)
- Use Koa as a backend framework, we use this framework for micro services
- Write tests (with any framework, however, we use Jest)
- Data persistence either with a JSON file, local storage, or SQLite
